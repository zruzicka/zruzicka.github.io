# JOTB22

For JOTB tech talks and details go directly to [J on the Beach website](https://www.jonthebeach.com/) and feel free to skip all here below. :)

This post aims to give kudos to my colleagues, JOTB organizers, and the conference speakers. Often our great and smooth experience depends on hard work or a commitment or simply on the action of others, and it's easy to overlook such details.

J on the Beach is a truly interesting conference and a great choice from my subjective point of view! It offers interesting tech topics, experienced speakers from all around the world, and many opportunities to talk with speakers and other attendees. :)

Tech talks encouraged me to look further into frameworks for API gateways, and Event Sourcing.

Málaga is a city with a fascinating vibe and plenty of options that go beyond a week.
As a real fan of outdoor activities, I can highlight the Caminito del Rey, the Alcazaba in Málaga, the Historic Botanical Gardens, and regular swimming in the sea. The sea was still chilly in April, and swims up to 22 minutes were my max, but come on, for most of us that's enough to stretch our bodies a bit during the week, so go for it!

In addition, considering our natural remote work approach and different locations, we joked with colleague Stefan that thanks to the conference, it was much easier for us to meet in person for a week in Malaga than in our Brno office. Such a truth! :D

Am I the only person whose mind and focus are very easily narrowed by day-to-day routines, and who is often initially hesitant to attend events like this, but when he goes, finds that he is glad he did? For me, it's a never-ending battle! :D

Stay open-minded, choose your conference and go-ahead for a new experience! :)

And hey, if you go there next year, see you in person at J on the Beach 2023!
