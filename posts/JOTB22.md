# J on the Beach

J on the Beach (JOTB) is a truly interesting conference in Málaga by the end of April. The motto is "bringing developers and devops together around big data". JOTB offers interesting tech topics, experienced speakers from all around the world, and many opportunities to talk with speakers and other attendees.

## Talks

For JOTB tech talks and organizational details about the conference go directly to J on the Beach website and feel free to skip all below. :)

I wouldn't expect to share the list of my selected talks publicly, but since I've been asked about my favourites several times recently, here they are:
* "Patterns for Graceful Extensibility in Distributed Software Systems" by Laura Nolan @lauralifts - Well done! :+1 :+1
* gRPC talk by Mario-Leander Reimer @leanderreimer highlights gRPC performance benefits.
* "Dealing with Failure" by Sergey Bykov @sergeybykov
* "Do Distributed Systems, they said. It'll be fun, they said" by Sara Pellegrini @_sara_p_ and Milan Savić @MilanSavic14 - Very nice summary of architectural design patterns and ways how to handle expected challenges in distributed systems environments.
* "APISIX - an API Gateway the Apache way" by Nicolas Fränkel @nicolas_frankel
* "Certificates and encryption; All you need to know, but..." by Pieter Van der Meer - Pretty good summary and demo about certificates! :+1
* Distributed Ledgers and Distributed Sets talk by Antonio Fernández Anta @Afdezanta - Very interesting talk and topic.
* As a bonus I want to mention Lightning Talk Winner Predrag Stojadinovic @stojadinovicp. I missed his talk in person, so I'm awaiting the recording.

Tech talks encouraged me to look further into frameworks for API gateways, and Event Sourcing. And of course, I need to learn gRPC!

## Málaga

Málaga is a city with a fascinating vibe and plenty of options that go beyond a week.
As a real fan of outdoor activities, I can highlight the Caminito del Rey, the Alcazaba in Málaga, the Historic Botanical Gardens, and regular swimming in the sea. The sea was still chilly in April, and swims up to 22 minutes were my max, but come on, for most of us that's enough to stretch our bodies a bit during the week, so go for it!

In addition, considering our natural remote work approach and different locations, we joked with colleague Stefan that thanks to the conference, it was much easier for us to meet in person for a week in Malaga than in our Brno office. Such a truth! :D

## Ending

Finally I want to give kudos to my colleagues, JOTB organizers, and the conference speakers. Often our great and smooth experience depends on hard work or a commitment or simply on the action of others, and it's easy to overlook such details.

Stay open-minded, choose your conference and go ahead for a new experience! :)

If you go there next year, see you in person at J on the Beach 2023!
And what is your favourite conference?
